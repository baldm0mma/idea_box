## Learning Goals

The IdeaBox Redux project is designed to implement JavaScript principles taught during the first five weeks at the Turing School. The project builds on the applications of JavaScript to provide a dynamic, functional website that can be used to store ideas, that persists upon a refresh of the page, and that can be deleted from localStorage. IdeaBox Redux requires proficient use of Git and GitHub to track feature changes, and requires mastery of the fundamentals of Flexbox and CSS Grid.
Student were also challenged to use a project management tool of choice, ours being Trello.
